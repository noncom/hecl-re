	* core/org/hecl/ListThing.java: Added cautionary/explanatory
	comment about ListThing vectors.

2008-10-06  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* net/org/hecl/HttpCmd.java: System.getProperty doesn't throw
	errors any more, when used with the new midlet applets.  However,
	it may return null for the properties in question.  Guard against
	this.

	* misc.xml: Added packageMidletApplets, which utilizes AppletTweak
	to create the applet jars from the midlet jars, for all applicable
	versions of Hecl.

	* core.xml: Added packageAppletTweak to create the jar file that
	goes on to tweak the midlet jars to make the suitable for

	* android/android.properties: Updated to 1.0 SDK.

2008-09-29  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* midp10/Hecl.java: Fiddled with the startup sequence to use
	evalIdle like the midp20 version, and break runScript out into its
	own thing that is only used by the applet version.

	* midp20/script.hcl: Eliminated ;'s from line endings.

	* midp20/Hecl.java: Store HeclTask associated with main script
	evaluation in order to wait for its completion in runScript, which
	is used for the Hecl Builder applets.

2008-09-20  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* net/org/hecl/HttpCmd.java: Catch any potential errors thrown by
	System.getProperty.  In reality there shouldn't be any, but the
	microemulator applet chokes on these calls.  We'll remove the
	try/catch statements when microemulator is fixed.

	* core/org/hecl/MathCmds.java: Added some more math commands to
	non cldc1.0 builds, thanks to Alexander Futasz

	* androidbuilder/org/hecl/androidbuilder/AndroidBuilder.java:
	Added some extra, hacky flags.  -intentfilter lets you pass in the
	name of an .xml file that will be added to the AndroidManifest.xml
	as the intent-receiver.  Also added an -extraclass flag that lets
	you pass the name of a .class file that you can add to the final
	result to be compiled.  I use this to generate an intent receiver
	for another application I'm working on.  This is all sort of
	hacky...

2008-04-08  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* android/res/raw/script.hcl: Added checkboxes and radiobuttons to
	the simple widgets and removed them from the main demo list.
	Make the script evaluator do an alert as well as returning a
	value.  Fixed gtalk system to send messages to me.  Removed
	subactivity... not really important.

	* commandline/Hecl.java: Fixed onDestroy callback so that it can
	be used by SubHecl.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/AndroidCmd.java: Removed some java
	commandsin favor of loading them on an as-needed bases at runtime:

	timepicker.

	* java/org/hecl/java/Reflector.java: Added more conversions:
	floats and doubles get transformed into the right java types now.
	Also, byte[] gets turned into a StringThing, and vice versa when
	going from StringThing to a byte[] signature.

2008-04-04  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/InterpCmds.java: Added a "thisinterp" command for
	the J2SE version, which returns an ObjectThing with the current
	interprter in it.  Also fixed the after command to return a handle
	to the event.

2008-03-24  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* android/res/raw/script.hcl: Added MenuSetup proc with new menu

	literal flag, as this is entirely covered in Interp's setVar
	method.

	either.

	* core/org/hecl/Parse.java: Set literal bit for all things created
	in the parser.

	* core/org/hecl/Interp.java: addTimer isn't synchronized any more
	- we synchronize on the timers object instead.  setVar: if the
	value is literal, make a deepcopy of it.

	* core/org/hecl/Stanza.java: Don't automatically set copy flag -
	it's not needed.

	* core/org/hecl/SubstThing.java: Added code to handle literal
	Things.

	* androidbuilder/org/hecl/androidbuilder/AndroidBuilder.java:
	Added permissions flag to set permissions in the
	AndroidManifest.xml file.  Tweaked icon stuff to use a name that

	Added a few more comments, command line options.

	* android/build.xml: Make a jar and then create the dex files from
	that.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/Hecl.java: Use a boolean to protect
	the interp creation code that should only be run once, instead of
	ugly class based code.  Added a createCommands method that gets
	overridden by facade classes created by AndroidBuilder.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/AndroidCmd.java: Moved hecl and
	subhecl command creation to Hecl.java itself, so that they can be
	subclassed by made up classes created by AndroidBuilder.

	applications.

	reworking to update to M5.

	* android/AndroidManifest.xml: Updated to M5.

	* tests/java.hcl: Added test for null parameter.

	* java/org/hecl/java/Reflector.java: Changed the way we pass
	things around in heclTypeToJavaType and mapParams: since we could
	legitimately be returning 'null', we utilize a one-element array
	to stash a return value in.  This fixes a problem we had with
	accepting null values.

	* java/org/hecl/java/NullCmd.java: Added separate null command here.

	* commandline/Hecl.java: Add in [null] command.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/AndroidCmd.java: Move the [null]

	* docs/hecl.xml: Reworked the installation/tools portion of the
	document, including a quick set of instructions of how to make
	Eclipse work with Hecl scripts, by Martin Mainusch
	<DONUS@gmx.net>.  Also redid some of the section on hacking the
	Hecl Java ME code.

	* jars/: Rearranged the Java ME jars.

2008-01-11  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* java/org/hecl/java/Reflector.java: Don't load methodnames until
	it's actually necessary.  This also speeds the load time.

	* android/android.properties: Added properties file so that people
	will have something to modify.

	needed.  This speeds the loading time, because the Hecl/Java
	integrations are only done when they're needed.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/AndroidCmd.java: Removed a number
	of commands, which can be loaded on an as-needed basis in order to

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/Hecl.java: Made interp static so
	that other things bundled with Hecl can access it, such as
	SubHecl.  Make sure to set the correct hecl instance in AndroidCmd
	on resume.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/AndroidCmd.java: Added intent
	command.  Changed 'log' command to androidlog so as to not
	conflict with the math operation log.

	* android/AndroidManifest.xml: Added ScriptProvider.

	* net/org/hecl/HttpCmd.java: We no longer need to pass the Interp
	to HttpRequest.

	* net/org/hecl/HttpRequest.java: *For the moment*, don't do the
	synchronized notify of the Interp object, as this conflicts with
	the synchronized version of Interp's eval method.  As a
	consequence, we also eliminate references to the object to
	synchronize on.

2008-01-08  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/HeclTask.java: Print stack trace even for 'normal'

	* core/org/hecl/Interp.java: Added fancier commandline completion
	system that completes first on the available command names, and
	subsequently on available variable names.
