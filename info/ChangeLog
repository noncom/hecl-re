2009-11-09  Wolfgang S. Kechel - data2c GmbH  <wolfgang.kechel@data2c.com>

	* core/org/hecl/DoubleThing.java (http): Reverted back to
	parseDouble since valueOf returns Double instead of double.

	* core/org/hecl/Parse.java (addCurrent): Enhanced to try even
	harder to generate numbers when possible. Checking for number now
	allows sign and exponent marker.

	* core/org/hecl/NumberThing.java (asNumber): 
	* core/org/hecl/LongThing.java: Added proper throw declaration.

	* core/org/hecl/DoubleThing.java (http): Use valueOf instead of
	parseDouble (faster). Added proper throw declaration.

2009-11-06  Wolfgang S. Kechel - data2c GmbH  <wolfgang.kechel@data2c.com>

	* core/org/hecl/StringCmds.java: Formfeed is now a default split
	character (since it is whitespace).

	* core/org/hecl/Parse.java: Added support for formfeed notation '\f'.

2009-11-05  Wolfgang S. Kechel - data2c GmbH  <wolfgang.kechel@data2c.com>

	* tests/performance.hcl: Updated to use new file.* commands.

	* tests/suite.hcl: 
	* tests/threads.hcl: 
	* tests/intro.hcl: Enhanced tests. intro-test needs to be run
	first to avoid clobbered global namespace. intro modified to ease
	checking for commands. More time can be spend on this to make it
	really elaborate. Changed thread test 2 to stop creation of
	background tasks when test is done. The old behavior caused some
	problems when the test run terminated (Java error empty stack).

	* core/org/hecl/Proc.java: Modified implementation to collect as
	much information as possible during creation and avoid to
	repeatedly redo the work for every invocation. This shall sage
	some execution cycles and speed up interpretation.
	Corrected subtle bug in stack treatment when non-HeclException has
	been thrown. Stack is now cleaned up properly in finally clause.

	* files/org/hecl/files/FileCmds.java: Added new commands
	file.absolutepath, file.canonicalpath, file.isabsolute, file.getcwd.
	Changed file.basename into file.name
	Changed file.delete to return result code.

	* blackberry.xml: Use properties file to override build location
	in order to separate stuff from j2me build environment.

	* blackberry/BrowserCmd.java: Added browser.open command to open
	the blackberry browser with a user-specified URL.

2009-08-18  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* midp20/script.hcl: Reworking the example script.  Fixed some
	whitespace issues (4, not 2:-), and don't display memory after
	each example invocation.

	* blackberry.xml: Improved BB build system to use its own 'main'
	Hecl.java file: blackberry/Hecl.java.  Currently it still uses
	most of the J2ME code.

2009-08-15  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/InterpCmds.java: Added alias command, which adds
	an alias using cmdAlias.

	* core/org/hecl/Interp.java: Added cmdAlias method which adds an
	alias for a command in the interpreter.

	instructions.

2009-08-12  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* midp20/script.hcl: Fix the numbers again.

	* midp20/Hecl.java: Use Alert.FOREVER instead of a specific
	timeout period.

	* midp20/script.hcl: New script, from Zakaria.  Allows editing of
	scripts.  Committing as-is, but probably needs some modifications.

2009-08-11  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* midp20/script.hcl: Make sure to only accept 255 characters in
	textfield.  Updated phone number.

	icon.

2009-04-30  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* docs/hecl.xml: Added kxml.gettext docs.

2009-04-29  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core.xml: Compile the java package along with the core in order
	to include the reflection stuff.

2009-03-25  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/Interp.java: Added a bit of code that does the
	following: if we haven't been able to look up a classcmd, try
	loading it up via the reflection stuff.

	* java/org/hecl/java/HeclJavaCmd.java: The 'java' command now has
	a one-argument version that takes only the name of a class that we
	wish to inform Hecl of.
