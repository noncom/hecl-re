      Hecl is designed to be small enough to run on mobile devices
      such as cell phones.  This means that for the Hecl core, has
      been necessary to limit ourselves to Java API's that work with
      J2ME.

	  Create a simple application with Hecl - Introducing Hecl, a mobile phone scripting
	  language </a>.  It is a tutorial style introduction writing Hecl code for mobile
	  phones, by David Welton.
      </p>

      <p>
	The aim of this tutorial is to help you create cell phone applications, so let's get started
	right away. You'll need a few things first:
      </p>

      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
	  <p>
	    Sun's Java.  With Ubuntu, you can get this like so:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="screen">apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk</pre>
	</li><li class="listitem">
	  <p>
	    <a class="link" href="http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/index.jsp" target="_top">Sun's

	    compile Hecl (unless you want to hack on it!), you do want
	    the emulator, so that you don't have to load your app onto
	    your phone each time you want to test it. It's not open
	    source software (yet?), but it does run on Linux, Mac and
	    Windows, and of course it is free.
	  </p>
	</li><li class="listitem">

	      <p>
		Hecl is always improving, so you should also consider checking out Hecl directly
		from git: <strong class="userinput"><code>git clone git://github.com/davidw/hecl.git</code></strong>
	      </p>
	    </td></tr></table></div><p>
	  </p>
	</li></ul></div>

      <p>
	Sun's WTK requires installation - you can put it somewhere like <code class="filename">/opt</code>,
	so it won't get mixed up with the rest of your system. The installation process is very
	simple - just say yes to a few questions, and you're done. Hecl doesn't require
	installation: everything you need is already there in the distribution.
      </p>

      <p>
	To see if everything's working, you can try launching the emulator with the sample
	application: <strong class="userinput"><code>/opt/WTK2.5.2/bin/emulator -classpath
	jars/cldc1.1-midp2.0/Hecl.jar Hecl</code></strong>
      </p>

      <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
	<p>
	  With version 3 of the Sun WTK (which as of 2010-01 only runs
	  on Windows and Mac), the command line you need is as
	  follows:

	  <strong class="userinput"><code>
	    /opt/WTK2.5.2/bin/emulator -Xjam:install jars/cldc1.1-midp2.0/Hecl.jad
	  </code></strong>
	</p>
      </td></tr></table></div>

      <p>That should bring up something like this:</p>

      <div class="screenshot">
	<div class="mediaobject"><img src="demo_screenshot.png"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1: Hecl demo screen shot</p></div></div>
      </div>

      <p>
	This is Hecl's built in demo - its source code is located in
	<code class="filename">midp20/script.hcl</code>, but before I get too far ahead of myself, let's go
	back and create the classic "Hello World" application, just to get started and see how to
	work with Hecl.
      </p>

      <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
	<p>
	  Hecl actually comes in several flavors, with slightly different GUI commands - MIDP1.0
	  (older phones), which has fewer commands and doesn't do as much, and MIDP2.0, for newer
	  phones, which has a lot more features. This tutorial utilizes the MIDP2.0 commands,
	  because that's what current phones are based on. The concepts described are very similar
	  for the MIDP1.0 commands, but the commands are slightly different. Please contact us if
	  you are interested in a MIDP1.0 version of this tutorial.
	</p>
      </td></tr></table></div>

      <p>
	To write your first Hecl program, open a text editor, and type the following program into a
	file - I'll call it <code class="filename">hello.hcl</code>:
      </p>

<pre class="programlisting">
proc HelloEvents {cmd form} {
    [lcdui.alert -text "Hellllllllooooo, world!" -timeout forever] setcurrent
}

set form [lcdui.form -title "Hello world" -commandaction HelloEvents]
set cmd [lcdui.command -label "Hello" -longlabel "Hello Command" -type screen]

$form setcurrent
$form addcommand $cmd

$form append [lcdui.stringitem -label "Hello" -text "World"]
</pre>

      <p>
	Not bad - 8 lines of code, and most of it's pretty clear just from looking at it. I'll go
	through it line by line, so you understand exactly what's happening.
      </p>

      <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
	  <p>
	    The first bit of code, that starts with <code class="code">proc HelloEvents</code>, defines a
	    "procedure": in other words a function called <span class="command"><strong>HelloEvents</strong></span>. When this
	    function is called, it creates an "alert" - think of it as a pop up message telling you
	    something important. <code class="option">-timeout forever</code> tells the message to stay on the
	    screen until the user dismisses it.
	  </p>
	</li><li class="listitem">
	  <p>
	    The second command defines a form, with the command <span class="command"><strong>lcdui.form</strong></span>, with
	    the title of "Hello World", and connected to the <span class="command"><strong>HelloEvents</strong></span>
	    proc. What this connection means is that when any commands associated with the form are
	    activated by the user, this procedure is called to handle them. The code <code class="code">set
	    form</code> stores the form object in the variable <code class="varname">form</code>, so that it
	    can be referenced later.
	  </p>
	</li><li class="listitem">
	  <p>
	    The following line creates a command that can be activated by the user. It has the label
	    "Hello", and is stored in the variable <code class="varname">cmd</code>. I use the
	    <code class="constant">screen</code> type for the command, which is used for user defined
	    commands. There are some other predefined types such as <code class="constant">exit</code> and
	    <code class="constant">back</code>.
	  </p>
	</li><li class="listitem">
	  <p>
	    <code class="code">$form setcurrent</code> references the previously created form, and tells Hecl to
	    display it on the screen.
	  </p>
	</li><li class="listitem">
	  <p>
	    The <span class="command"><strong>addcommand</strong></span> subcommand (you could also think of it as a "method",
	    like in an object oriented language) attaches the command I created above to the
	    form. This makes the command visible in the form.
	  </p>
	</li><li class="listitem">
	  <p>
	    Finally, I display a string on the form with the <span class="command"><strong>lcdui.stringitem</strong></span>
	    command. On most phones, the <code class="option">-label</code> text is displayed in bold, and the
	    <code class="option">-text</code> text is displayed next to it.
	  </p>
	</li></ol></div>

      <p>
	That's it! Now, to transform the code into a cell phone application, run a command:
      </p>

<pre class="programlisting">
java -jar jars/JarHack.jar -hecljar jars/cldc1.1-midp2.0/Hecl.jar \
    -destdir ~/ -name Hello -script hello.hcl
</pre>

      <p>
	This is all it takes - this command takes the existing <code class="filename">Hecl.jar</code> file,
	and replaces the Hecl script within with our newly created <code class="filename">hello.hcl</code>
	script, and creates the resulting <code class="filename">Hello.jar</code> in your home directory
	(referenced as <code class="filename">~/</code> in the command above).
      </p>

      <p>
	Now, we can run the code in the emulator to see the application:
      </p>

<pre class="programlisting">
/opt/WTK2.5.2/bin/emulator -cp ~/Hello.jar Hecl
</pre>

      <div class="screenshot">
	<div class="mediaobject"><img src="hello_screenshot1.png"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2: Hecl Hello World screenshot</p></div></div>
      </div>

      <p>
	Highlighted, from the top, are the form's <code class="option">-title</code>, the
	<span class="command"><strong>stringitem</strong></span>, and in the lower right corner, the command labeled Hello.
      </p>

      <p>
	If you press the "hello" button, the code in <span class="command"><strong>HelloEvents</strong></span> is executed, and
	an "alert" is popped up onto the screen, and stays there until you hit the "Done"
	button.
      </p>

      <p>
	While creating an application is very easy, unfortunately, installing it on a phone is not;
	there isn't much that Hecl can do to ease that process, which is different for each
	phone. On Linux, for my Nokia telephone, I use the gammu program to transfer programs to my
	phone, like so:
      </p>

      <pre class="programlisting">gammu nothing --nokiaaddfile Application Hecl</pre>

      <p>
	Another method that may work better across different phones is to use the phone's browser to
	download and install the application, by placing the <code class="filename">.jar</code> and
	<code class="filename">.jad</code> files on a publicly accessible web server, and accessing the
	<code class="filename">.jad</code> file.

      </p>

      <p>
	So far so good. Next, I'll create a small application that you can interact with to do
	something useful. It's a simplified version of the shopping list that can be found <a class="link" href="http://shoplist.dedasys.com" target="_top">here</a>. The theory of operation behind this
	application is simple: typing a shopping list into a mobile phone is pretty painful - it's
	much better to do the data entry via a web page, and then fetch the list with the mobile
	phone application.
      </p>

      <p>
	For this tutorial, I've created a simple list on the ShopList web site, with the PIN number
	<code class="constant">346764</code>, which can be viewed <a class="link" href="http://shoplist.dedasys.com/list/show/346764" target="_top">here</a>. Feel free to create your
	own shopping lists - the site costs nothing to use. The cell phone application works like
	so: by entering the PIN, it downloads the list of items and displays them on the phone
	screen as a series of checkboxes. Have a look at the code to do this:
      </p>

<pre class="programlisting">
# Process events associated with the shopping list screen.
proc ShopListEvents {exitcmd backcmd cmd shoplist} {
    if { eq $cmd $exitcmd } {
	midlet.exit
    } elseif { eq $cmd $backcmd } {
	global shopform
	$shopform setcurrent
    }
}

# Create a new shopping list screen and fetch .
proc MakeList {exitcmd backcmd pin} {
    set url "http://shoplist.dedasys.com/list/fetch/${pin}"
    # Fetch the data, and retrieve the data field from the results hash.
    set data [hget [http.geturl $url] data]
    if { eq $data "PIN NOT FOUND" } {
	[lcdui.alert -type warning \
	     -title "Pin Not Found" \
	     -timeout forever\
	     -text "The PIN $pin was not found on shoplist.dedasys.com"] setcurrent
	return
    }
    set shoplist [lcdui.list -title "Shopping List" \
		      -type multiple]
    foreach e [split $data \n] {
	$shoplist append $e
    }
    $shoplist addcommand $exitcmd
    $shoplist addcommand $backcmd
    $shoplist setcurrent
    $shoplist configure -commandaction \
	[list ShopListEvents $exitcmd $backcmd]
}

# Process events associated with the main form.
proc ShopFormEvents {backcmd exitcmd pinfield
		     fetchcmd cmd shopform} {
    if { eq $cmd $exitcmd } {
	midlet.exit
    } elseif { eq $fetchcmd $cmd } {
	MakeList $exitcmd $backcmd \
	    [$pinfield cget -text]
    }
}

# The action starts here...

# Create a generic back command.
set backcmd [lcdui.command \
		 -label Back \
		 -longlabel Back -type back -priority 1]
# Create an exit command.
set exitcmd [lcdui.command \
		 -label Exit \
		 -longlabel Exit -type exit -priority 2]

# Create the form.
set shopform [lcdui.form -title "Shopping List"]
set pinfield [lcdui.textfield \
		  -label "shoplist.dedasys.com PIN:" \
	          -type numeric]
set fetchcmd [lcdui.command -label "Fetch" \
		  -longlabel "Fetch Shopping List" \
		  -type screen -priority 1]

$shopform append $pinfield
$shopform addcommand $exitcmd
$shopform addcommand $fetchcmd
$shopform setcurrent

$shopform configure -commandaction \
    [list ShopFormEvents $backcmd $exitcmd $pinfield $fetchcmd]
</pre>

      <p>
	This is certainly more complex than the first example, but the general pattern is the same -
	screen widgets and items are created, displayed, and procs are called to deal with
	commands.
      </p>

      <p>
	As I mentioned previously, commands with specific, predefined tasks have their own types, as
	I can see with the <span class="command"><strong>back</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>exit</strong></span> commands, which are respectively
	of types "back" and "exit".
      </p>

      <p>
	After the two commands are defined, I create a form and add a textfield to it. By specifying
	<code class="option">-type numeric</code> for the textfield, I indicate that it is only to accept
	numbers - no letters or symbols.
      </p>

      <p>
	After creating the Fetch command, I append the textfield to the form (or else it wouldn't be
	visible), add the two commands to the form, and then, with <span class="command"><strong>setcurrent</strong></span>,
	make the form visible. The last line of code configures the form to utilize the
	<span class="command"><strong>ShopFormEvents</strong></span> proc to handle events. The list argument warrants further
	explanation:
      </p>

      <p>
	Hecl, like many programming languages, has a <span class="command"><strong>global</strong></span> command that could be
	used in the various procs that utilize the <span class="command"><strong>back</strong></span> and
	<span class="command"><strong>exit</strong></span> commands - you could simply say <code class="code">global backcmd</code>, and
	then the <code class="varname">$backcmd</code> variable would be available in that procedure. However,
	using global variables all over the place gets kind of messy, so what I want to do is pass
	in everything that the proc might need, and I do so by creating a list: <code class="code">ShopFormEvents
	$backcmd $exitcmd $pinfield $fetchcmd</code>. You can see that these corresponds to the
	arguments that the proc takes: <code class="code">proc ShopFormEvents {backcmd exitcmd pinfield fetchcmd
	cmd shopform}</code>, except for the last two, which Hecl
	<span class="emphasis"><em>automatically</em></span> passes in. <code class="varname">cmd</code> is the command that was
	actually called, and <code class="varname">shopform</code> is of course the form that the proc was
	called with. By comparing <code class="varname">$cmd</code> with the various commands that are
	available, it's possible to determine which command called the proc, and act accordingly.
      </p>


      <p>Now, let's build it and run it:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
java -jar jars/JarHack.jar -hecljar jars/cldc1.1-midp2.0/Hecl.jar \
    -destdir ~/ -name ShopList -script shoplist.hcl
/opt/WTK2.5.2/bin/emulator -classpath ShopList.jar Hecl
</pre>

      <div class="screenshot">
	<div class="mediaobject"><img src="shoplist1.png"><div class="caption">
	    <p>Figure 3: Initial shoplist form</p>
	  </div></div>

      </div>

      <p>
	At this point, you enter the PIN number (<code class="constant">346764</code>), and press the Fetch
	button. This command executes the code in <span class="command"><strong>MakeList</strong></span>. The first thing it
	does is attempt to fetch the data from the shoplist site, using the
	<span class="command"><strong>http.geturl</strong></span> command. Since this command returns a hash table, in order to
	get at the data returned, I use the <span class="command"><strong>hget</strong></span> command to access the "data"
	element. If the PIN was not available on the server, an error message is returned, and the
	user is returned to the first screen. Otherwise, a list of checkboxes is created with
	<span class="command"><strong>lcdui.list</strong></span>, by specifying "multiple" as the type. Since the shopping list
	is sent "over the wire" (so to speak...) as a list of lines, all I have to do to add it to
	the display is split it by lines with the <span class="command"><strong>split</strong></span> command, and then iterate
	over that list with <span class="command"><strong>foreach</strong></span>. The result looks like that displayed figure
	4.
      </p>

      <div class="screenshot">
	<div class="mediaobject"><img src="shoplist2.png"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4: Shopping List</p></div></div>
      </div>

      <p>
	And there you have it, a network-based shopping list in less than 100 lines of code. Of
	course, there is room for improvement. For instance, in the production version of this
	shopping list application, RecordStore (in Hecl, the <span class="command"><strong>rms.*</strong></span> commands make
	this functionality available) is utilized to save the list and its state between invocations
	of the program, so that you can leave the application, run it again, and find the list as
	you left it. Support for multiple lists might also be handy.
      </p>

      <p>
	Of course, this tutorial barely scratches the surface. Hecl has a number of other GUI
	commands, and is a complete programming language that can do some interesting and dynamic
	things. If you're curious, the best way to learn more is to keep reading the documentation,
	and sign up for the <a class="link" href="http://groups.google.com/group/hecl" target="_top">Hecl Google
	Group</a>, which can be accessed either as a web forum or as a mailing list.
