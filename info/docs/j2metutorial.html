    <p>
      These days, almost everyone has a cell phone, and cell phones keep getting faster, smarter,
      and more capable, yet relatively few applications exist for them.  The Hecl programming
      language makes it easy to script applications for your cell phone - with just a few lines of
      code, you can create applications that you can carry with you, everywhere.
    </p>

    <h1>Easy Cell Phone Applications with Hecl</h1>

    <p>
      I first fell in love with computers when my parents bought me a Commodore 64, a fairly nice
      computer for the time.  Thanks to Moore's law, and the relentless pace of development, the
      average cell phone is now more powerful than that machine from just 20 some years ago.  While
      it's understandable that many people just want to make phone calls, think of all the programs
      out there waiting to be written that take advantage of the fact that you almost always have a
      cell phone with you.  I think we're just beginning to scratch the surface of what's possible,
      especially as phones continue to get faster, and have better connections to the Internet.
    </p>

    <p>
      I became interested in writing cell phone applications several years ago, after a rainy day
      high in the Italian Dolomites near Cortina d'Ampezzo - my old phone ended up in a mud puddle
      and died, leading me to purchase a new phone with J2ME (Java) capabilities.  Writing
      applications in Java was OK, but I thought to myself that it would be an interesting
      experiment to try and create a scripting language that runs on top of the J2ME (now known as
      Java Micro Edition or Java ME) environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I created Hecl, I did so with several goals in mind:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make it even easier and faster for experienced programmers to create cell phone
      applications.</li>

      <li>
	Make it possible for novice programmers to create cell phone applications without the burden
	of dealing with Java.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Hecl has other benefits too - it's faster to develop applications, because you don't have to
      recompile after each change.  In the hands of a clever programmer, it's also possible to do
      interesting things with Hecl because of its interpreted nature.  You could start an
      application on your phone, and download additional bits of code off the web.
    </p>

    <p>
      The aim of this tutorial is to help you create cell phone applications, so let's get started
      right away.  We'll need a few things first:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Sun's Java.  This is heading towards open source, but isn't quit there yet.  If you run
	Ubuntu, like me, you can get Java with apt: <code>apt-get install sun-java5-jdk</code>, if
	you've added the "multiverse" repositories to your <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file:
	<code>deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ feisty multiverse</code>
      </li>

      <li>
	Sun's WTK toolkit.  While you don't need the tools to compile Hecl (unless you want to hack
	on it!), you do want the emulator, so that you don't have to load your app onto your phone
	each time you want to test it.  It's not open source software (yet?), but it does run on
	Linux, Mac and Windows.  You can download the WTK here, for free: <a
	href="http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/download-2_5_1.html">http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/download-2_5_1.html</a>
      </li>
      <li>
	Hecl itself.  You can get it from the Sourceforge download page: <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=122383">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=122383</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Sun's WTK requires installation - you can put it somewhere like <code>/opt</code>, so it won't
      mixed up with the rest of your system.  The installation process is very simple - just say yes
      to a few questions, and you're done.  Hecl doesn't require installation - everything you need
      is already there in the distribution.
    </p>

    <p>To see if everything's working, you can try launching the emulator with the sample
    application:</p>

    <p>
      <code>
/opt/WTK2.5.1/bin/emulator -classpath build/j2me/final/cldc1.1-midp2.0/Hecl.jar Hecl
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>That should bring up something like this:</p>

    <img src="demo_screenshot.png" alt="Figure 1: Hecl demo screen shot.">

    <p>
      This is Hecl's built in Demo - it's source code is located in <code>midp20/script.hcl</code>,
      but before I get too far ahead of myself, let's go back and create the classic Hello World
      application, just to get started and see how to work with Hecl.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> Hecl actually comes in several flavors, with slightly different GUI
      commands - MIDP1.0 (older phones), which has fewer commands and doesn't do as much, and
      MIDP2.0, for newer phones, which has a lot more features.  This tutorial utilizes the MIDP2.0
      commands, because that's what current phones are based on.  The concepts described are very
      similar for the MIDP1.0 commands, but the commands are slightly different.  Please contact the
      author if you are interested in a MIDP1.0 version of this tutorial.
    </p>

    <h2>Hello World cell phone application</h2>
    <p>
      To write your first Hecl program, open a text editor, and type the following program into a
      file - we'll call it <code>hello.hcl</code>:
    </p>

    <pre><![CDATA[
proc HelloEvents {cmd form} {
    [lcdui.alert -text "Hellllllllooooo, world!" -timeout forever] setcurrent
}

set form [lcdui.form -title "Hello world" -commandaction HelloEvents]
set cmd [lcdui.command -label "Hello" -longlabel "Hello Command" -type screen]

$form setcurrent
$form addcommand $cmd

$form append [lcdui.stringitem -label "Hello" -text "World"]
]]>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Not bad - 8 lines of code, and most of it's pretty clear just from looking at it.   Let's go
      through it line by line, to understand exactly what's happening.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	The first bit of code, that starts with <code>proc HelloEvents</code> defines a "procedure",
	in other words a function, called <code>HelloEvents</code>.  When this function is called,
	it creates an "alert" - think of it as a pop up message telling you something important.
	<code>-timeout forever</code> tells the message to stay on the screen until the user
	dismisses it.
      </li>

      <li>
	The second command defines a form, with the command <code>lcdui.form</code>, with the title
	of "Hello World", and connected to the <code>HelloEvents</code> proc.  What this connection
	means is that when any commands associated with the form are activated by the user, this
	procedure is called to handle them.  The code <code>set form</code> stores the form object
	in the variable <code>form</code>, so that it can be referenced later.
      </li>

      <li>
	The following line creates a command that can be activated by the user.  It has the label
	"Hello", and is stored in the variable <code>cmd</code>.  We use the <code>screen</code>
	type for the command, which is used for user defined commands.  There are some pre-defined
	types such as "exit", "back".
      </li>

      <li><code>$form setcurrent</code> references the previously created form, and tells Hecl to
      display it on the screen.
      </li>

      <li>
	The <code>addcommand</code> subcommand (you could also think of it as a 'method', like in an
	object oriented language) attaches the command we created above to the form.  This makes the
	command visible in the form.
      </li>

      <li>
	Finally, we display a string on the form with the <code>lcdui.stringitem</code> command.  On
	most phones, the -label text is displayed in bold, and the -text text is displayed next to
	it.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>That's it!  Now, to transform the code into a cell phone application, we run a command:</p>

    <p>
      <code>
 java -jar jars/JarHack.jar jars/cldc1.1-midp2.0/Hecl.jar ~/ Hello hello.hcl
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      This is all it takes - this command takes the existing <code>Hecl.jar</code> file, and
      replaces the Hecl script within with our newly created <code>hello.hcl</code> script, and
      creates the resulting <code>Hello.jar</code> in your home directory (referenced as
      <code>~/</code> in the command above).
    </p>

    <p>Now, we can run the code in the emulator to see the application:</p>

    <img src="hello_screenshot1.png" alt="Figure 2: Hecl Hello World screenshot.">

    <p>
      Highlighted, from the top, are the form's <code>-title</code>, the stringitem, and in the
      lower right corner, the command labeled Hello.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you press the hello button, the code in <code>HelloEvents</code> is executed, and an
      "alert" is popped up onto the screen, and stays there until you hit the 'Done' button.
    </p>

    <h2>Installing the code on your phone</h2>

    <p>
      While creating an application is very easy, unfortunately, installing it on a phone is not,
      and there isn't much that Hecl can do to ease that process, which is different for each phone.
      On Linux, for my Nokia telephone, I use the gammu program to transfer programs to my phone,
      like so:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>gammu nothing --nokiaaddfile Application Hecl</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Another method that may work better across different phones is to use the phone's browser to
      download and install the application, by placing the .jar and .jad files on a publicly
      accessible web server, and accessing the .jad file.  <i>Note that this will likely cost money
      in connection charges!</i>
    </p>

    <h2>Next steps - Shopping List application</h2>

    <p>
      So far so good.  Next, we'll create a small application that you can interact with to do
      something useful.  It's a simplified version of the shopping list that can be found here: <a
      href="http://shoplist.dedasys.com">http://shoplist.dedasys.com</a>.  The theory of operation
      behind this application is simple: typing a shopping list into a mobile phone is pretty
      painful - it's much better to do the data entry via a web page, and then fetch the list with
      the mobile phone application.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this tutorial, I've created a simple list on the ShopList web site, with the PIN number
      <b>346764</b>, which can be viewed here: <a
      href="http://shoplist.dedasys.com/list/show/346764">http://shoplist.dedasys.com/list/show/346764</a>.
      Feel free to create your own shopping lists - the site costs nothing to use.  The cell phone
      application works like so: by entering the PIN, it downloads the list of items and displays
      them on the phone screen as a series of checkboxes.  Let's look at the code to do this:
    </p>

    <pre><![CDATA[
# Process events associated with the shopping list screen.
proc ShopListEvents {exitcmd backcmd cmd shoplist} {
    if { eq $cmd $exitcmd } {
	midlet.exit
    } elseif { eq $cmd $backcmd } {
	global shopform
	$shopform setcurrent
    }
}

# Create a new shopping list screen and fetch .
proc MakeList {exitcmd backcmd pin} {
    set url "http://shoplist.dedasys.com/list/fetch/${pin}"
    # Fetch the data, and retrieve the data field from the results hash.
    set data [hget [http.geturl $url] data]
    if { eq $data "PIN NOT FOUND" } {
	[lcdui.alert -type warning \
	     -title "Pin Not Found" \
	     -timeout forever\
	     -text "PIN $pin not found on shoplist.dedasys.com"] setcurrent
	return
    }
    set shoplist [lcdui.list -title "Shopping List" \
		      -type multiple]
    foreach e [split $data \n] {
	$shoplist append $e
    }
    $shoplist addcommand $exitcmd
    $shoplist addcommand $backcmd
    $shoplist setcurrent
    $shoplist configure -commandaction \
	[list ShopListEvents $exitcmd $backcmd]
}

# Process events associated with the main form.
proc ShopFormEvents {backcmd exitcmd pinfield
		     fetchcmd cmd shopform} {
    if { eq $cmd $exitcmd } {
	midlet.exit
    } elseif { eq $fetchcmd $cmd } {
	MakeList $exitcmd $backcmd \
	    [$pinfield cget -text]
    }
}

# The action starts here...

# Create a generic back command.
set backcmd [lcdui.command \
		 -label Back \
		 -longlabel Back -type back -priority 1]
# Create an exit command.
set exitcmd [lcdui.command \
		 -label Exit \
		 -longlabel Exit -type exit -priority 2]

# Create the form.
set shopform [lcdui.form -title "Shopping List"]
set pinfield [lcdui.textfield \
		  -label "shoplist.dedasys.com PIN:" \
	          -type numeric]
set fetchcmd [lcdui.command -label "Fetch" \
		  -longlabel "Fetch Shopping List" \
		  -type screen -priority 1]

$shopform append $pinfield
$shopform addcommand $exitcmd
$shopform addcommand $fetchcmd
$shopform setcurrent

$shopform configure -commandaction \
    [list ShopFormEvents $backcmd $exitcmd $pinfield $fetchcmd]
]]>
    </pre>

    <p>
      This is certainly more complex than the first example, but the general pattern is the same -
      screen widgets and items are created, displayed, and procs are called to deal with commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we mentioned previously, commands with specific, predefined tasks have their own types, as
      we can see with the back and exit commands, which are respectively of types "back" and "exit".
    </p>
    <p>
      After the two commands are defined, we create a form, and add a textfield to it.  By
      specifying <code>-type numeric</code> for the textfield, we indicate that it is only to accept
      numbers - no letters or symbols.
    </p>
    <p>
      After creating the Fetch command, we append the textfield to the form (or else it wouldn't be
      visible), add the two commands to the form, and then, with <code>setcurrent</code>, make the
      form visible.  The last line of code configures the form to utilize the
      <code>ShopFormEvents</code> proc to handle events.  The list argument warrants further
      explanation:
    </p>

    <p>
      Hecl, like many programming languages, has a <code>global</code> command that could be used in
      the various procs that utilize the back and exit commands - you could simply say <code>global
      backcmd</code>, and then the <code>$backcmd</code> variable would be available in that
      procedure.  However, using global variables all over the place gets kind of messy, so what we
      want to do is pass in everything that the proc might need, and we do so by creating a list:
      <code>ShopFormEvents $backcmd $exitcmd $pinfield $fetchcmd</code>.  You can see that these
      corresponds to the arguments that the proc takes: <code>proc ShopFormEvents {backcmd exitcmd
      pinfield fetchcmd <b>cmd</b> <b>shopform</b>}</code>, except for the last
      two, which Hecl <i>automatically</i> passes in.  <code>cmd</code> is the command that was
      actually called, and <code>shopform</code> is of course the form that the proc was called
      with.  By comparing <code>$cmd</code> with the various commands that are available, it's
      possible to determine which command called the proc, and act accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, let's build it and run it:
    </p>

    <pre><![CDATA[
java -jar jars/JarHack.jar jars/cldc1.1-midp2.0/Hecl.jar ~/ ShopList shoplist.hcl
/opt/WTK2.5.1/bin/emulator -classpath ShopList.jar Hecl
]]>
    </pre>

    <img src="shoplist1.png" alt="Figure 3: Initial shoplist form.">

    <p>
      At this point, we enter the PIN number (<b>346764</b>), and press the Fetch button.  At this
      point, the code in <code>MakeList</code> is executed.  The first thing it does is attempt to
      fetch the data from the shoplist site, using the <code>http.geturl</code> command.  Since this
      command returns a hash table, in order to get at the data returned, we use the
      <code>hget</code> command to access the "data" element.  If the PIN was not available on the
      server, an error message is returned, and the user is returned to the first screen.
      Otherwise, a list of checkboxes is created with <code>lcdui.list</code>, by specifying
      "multiple" as the type.  Since the shopping list is sent "over the wire" (so to speak...) as a
      list of lines, all we have to do to add it to the display is split it by lines with the
      <code>split</code> command, and then iterate over that list with <code>foreach</code>.  The
      result looks like this:
    </p>

    <img src="shoplist2.png" alt="Figure 4: Shopping List.">

    <p>
      And there you have it, a network-based shopping list in less than 100 lines of code.  Of
      course, there is room for improvement.  For instance, in the production version of this
      shopping list application, RecordStore (in Hecl, the rms.* commands make this functionality
      available)is utilized to save the list and its state between invocations of the program, so
      that you can leave the application, run it again, and find the list as you left it.  Support
      for multiple lists might also be handy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, this tutorial barely scratches the surface.  Hecl has a number of other GUI
      commands, and is a complete programming language that can do some interesting and dynamic
      things.  If you're curious, the best way to learn more is to have a look at the Hecl <a
